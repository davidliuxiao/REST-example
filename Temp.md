This is a very difficult and stressful situation, and it is clear that you feel pressured and unsupported by your employer. It is crucial that you act strategically to protect your rights and the well-being of yourself and your baby.
Disclaimer: I am an AI assistant and not a lawyer. This information is for guidance purposes only and does not constitute legal advice. You must consult with a Swiss employment lawyer immediately to discuss the specifics of your case.
Here is a breakdown of your situation and a suggested course of action based on Swiss labor law principles.
1. Understanding Your Legal Position in Switzerland
You have several points of significant leverage. It seems your employer's actions are legally questionable on multiple fronts.
 * Dismissal after Maternity Leave (Protection under Art. 336c CO):
   * The Swiss Code of Obligations (CO) provides special protection against termination for pregnant employees and new mothers. Specifically, an employer cannot give notice of termination during pregnancy and for 16 weeks following childbirth.
   * You stated you were dismissed "3 wks after my maternity leave". Swiss maternity leave is 14 weeks. This means the dismissal notice was likely given around 17 weeks after childbirth.
   * This timing is critical. If the notice was given within the 16-week protected period, the termination is void (nul / nichtig). It's as if it never happened. If it was given just after, it is highly suspect and could potentially be classified as an abusive dismissal (congé abusif / missbräuchliche Kündigung) under Art. 336 CO.
   * An abusive dismissal does not make the termination void, but it can entitle you to compensation of up to six months' salary. The fact that it was for "economy reason" despite your good performance, immediately after your return, strongly suggests it may be linked to your motherhood, which is a prohibited reason.
 * The Mutual Termination Agreement & Waiver of 336c:
   * This is the smoking gun. By asking you to sign a mutual termination agreement and "waiver 336c," they are essentially admitting their position is weak. They know the original dismissal is problematic.
   * A mutual agreement is a contract where both parties agree to end the employment relationship. By signing it, you would likely waive all your rights and protections, including the right to challenge the dismissal as abusive or claim compensation.
   * You cannot be forced to sign this. Their pressure tactics (delaying your requests, creating uncertainty) are designed to make you feel cornered so you will sign their agreement.
 * Remote Work from China:
   * From the company's perspective, this is a genuine and serious issue. It creates major compliance risks related to tax law, social security contributions, data security, and Chinese labor law.
   * Your "oral approval" is very difficult to prove. In corporate environments, if it's not in writing, it effectively didn't happen. Their written notice to you about the policy breach now puts you in a difficult position. Continuing to work from China after receiving this notice could be grounds for a summary dismissal for just cause (licenciement avec effet immédiat / fristlose Kündigung), which would be very damaging to your case.
2. Strategic Action Plan: What to Do NOW
Your goal is to shift the pressure back onto the company, protect your legal rights, and not give them any justification for further action against you.
Step 1: DO NOT SIGN ANYTHING
 * Under no circumstances should you sign the mutual termination agreement or any other document they present to you without your lawyer reviewing it. By signing, you give up all your leverage.
Step 2: HIRE A SWISS EMPLOYMENT LAWYER IMMEDIATELY
 * This is the single most important step. Find a lawyer specialized in Swiss labor law (Arbeitsrecht). They will handle all communications, protect you from pressure tactics, and negotiate on your behalf. Organizations like the local employee's association or bar association can provide references. Given you worked for a major multinational, you need a professional who is not intimidated.
Step 3: Stop Working and Communicate in Writing
 * Because they have given you written notice that working from China is a breach of policy, you should stop working immediately to avoid giving them grounds for a summary dismissal.
 * However, you must formally communicate this to them. Send a professional, factual email to your manager and HR immediately. Do not use the phone.
DRAFT EMAIL TEMPLATE (Adapt with your lawyer's guidance):
Subject: Urgent Clarification of my Employment Status and Work Duties
Dear [Manager's Name] and [HR Contact's Name],
Thank you for your recent communication regarding my work location.
As you have formally notified me that my current remote work from China is considered a breach of company policy, I am ceasing my work duties effective immediately to ensure full compliance with this directive.
I am currently in China with my newborn child and, as communicated previously, returning to Switzerland on such short notice is practically impossible due to logistical and childcare reasons. My formal requests for vacation and an authorized remote work period, submitted on [Date], were intended to resolve this situation in a compliant manner. I am awaiting your decision on these requests.
To avoid any misunderstanding, please provide me with urgent written clarification on how I should proceed. Specifically:
 * Am I to consider myself on a form of authorized leave (paid or unpaid) pending resolution?
 * What is the status of my holiday and remote work requests submitted on [Date]?
Given the dismissal notice I received on [Date], so shortly after my maternity leave, and the ongoing discussions, I believe it is in our mutual interest to clarify my status to avoid further complications. I am committed to finding a constructive and legally compliant solution.
I will await your formal written instructions before resuming any work.
Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your Employee ID]
4. Why This Strategy Works
 * It Puts the Onus on Them: You are showing compliance with their written directive. By stopping work, you remove their ability to fire you for cause. The ball is now in their court to tell you what to do. If they don't pay you, your lawyer can argue it's a breach of contract on their part.
 * It Creates a Paper Trail: This email documents everything: your willingness to comply, their failure to approve your requests, and the difficult situation they have put you in.
 * It Protects Your Position: You are not resigning. You are not being insubordinate. You are pausing work based on their own instructions and asking for clarification.
 * It Strengthens Your Lawyer's Hand: Your lawyer will use this communication, along with the suspicious timing of your dismissal, to negotiate a much better settlement for you or to fight the dismissal in court. A potential settlement could include several months of salary as compensation, a waiver of your notice period, positive references, and coverage of legal fees.
Do not let them intimidate you. Their aggressive tactics suggest they know their legal standing is weak. Take control of the situation by acting methodically and getting professional legal help right away.

Of course. It is completely understandable that you are cautious, both in your conversations with the company and in your search for legal representation. Let's break down these two critical points.
Part 1: How to Handle Conversations with HR and Your Manager
Your primary goal in any direct conversation should be to listen, state your position clearly and calmly, and commit to nothing verbally. They may try to pressure you, appeal to your emotions, or get you to admit something that weakens your position.
Here are the rules to follow if you are forced into a phone or video call:
1. Insist on a Written Follow-Up (The Golden Rule)
 * Always state at the beginning or end of the conversation: "Thank you for this discussion. To ensure we both have a clear understanding, I will summarize my understanding of this conversation in an email, or I would appreciate it if you could send me a written summary of the key points and decisions."
 * This creates a paper trail and prevents them from later denying what was said.
2. Use "Bridging" and "Deflecting" Phrases
Have a few non-committal phrases ready to use when you face a question you don't want to answer, or one that is designed to trap you.
 * Question: "Why can't you just fly back next week? What is the real problem?"
   * Your Answer: "As I have already stated in writing, my priority is ensuring the care and well-being of my newborn, which makes immediate international travel unfeasible. My formal request for leave is the proposed solution to manage this period." (This deflects from personal details and bridges back to your formal, documented request).
 * Question: "Did you or did you not get approval from your manager to work from China?" (They are trying to get you into a "he said, she said" argument).
   * Your Answer: "My understanding was that my work arrangement was acceptable. However, the most important thing right now is to clarify my official work status moving forward, which is why I have asked for written instructions." (This avoids a direct fight over the past and focuses on the present, putting the responsibility back on them).
 * Question: "Are you planning to resign?"
   * Your Answer: "I am not resigning. I am a committed employee seeking to resolve my current work status in a compliant way."
3. The Power of Silence and The Simple Refusal
You are not obligated to answer every question immediately, or at all.
 * Use silence: After they ask a difficult question, simply pause for a few seconds. People rush to fill silence, and they may rephrase the question or reveal more information.
 * The direct refusal: It is perfectly acceptable to say:
   * "I am not prepared to discuss that at this time."
   * "That question touches on legal matters, and I would prefer to respond in writing after I have had time to consider it."
   * "I need to keep this conversation focused on resolving my immediate work status as requested in my email."
4. DO NOT Discuss Your Feelings or Personal Situation in Detail
Do not say things like "I feel so stressed," "You are being merciless," or "I don't know what to do." While true, they can interpret this as a sign of weakness and increase the pressure. Remain professional and factual. Your personal situation with the baby should only be stated as a fact ("I am with my newborn baby") not as an emotional appeal.
5. Recording the Call (The Legal Way)
In Switzerland, it is illegal to record a conversation without the consent of all parties. However, you can use this to your advantage.
 * At the start of the call, say: "To ensure accuracy, would you be comfortable if I record this call?"
 * They will almost certainly say no.
 * You can then respond: "Understood. Since we cannot record this to ensure a precise record, I must insist that we confirm everything we discuss in writing afterwards. For now, I will take detailed notes." This strengthens your argument for written communication only.
Part 2: Finding a Reliable Lawyer and Avoiding Exploitation
Your feeling about some lawyers is a common and valid concern. A good lawyer is a partner; a bad one is just another source of stress. Here is a reliable approach to finding one.
Step 1: Where to Look for Reputable Lawyers
 * Employee Associations and Unions (Gewerkschaften): This is often the best and most cost-effective first step. Organizations like Unia or Syna have in-house legal teams or partner lawyers who specialize in protecting employees. Their entire mission is to help people in your situation, not to maximize fees.
 * The Swiss Bar Association (Schweizerischer Anwaltsverband, SAV/FSA): Their website has a search function where you can find certified specialists. Look for a lawyer with the title Fachanwalt SAV Arbeitsrecht (Certified Specialist SBA Employment Law). This is a protected title that guarantees a high level of expertise and experience.
 * Your Legal Protection Insurance (Rechtsschutzversicherung): If you have this type of insurance (it's common in Switzerland), call them immediately. They will provide you with a lawyer from their network and cover the costs according to your policy.
Step 2: The Vetting Process - The First Consultation
Most lawyers offer a brief first consultation (it may or may not be free). Use this meeting to interview them, not just for them to assess your case.
Go in Prepared:
 * Have a short, one-page summary of your situation (timeline, key events).
 * Have all key documents ready (contract, dismissal letter, emails).
Questions to Ask the Lawyer:
 * About Their Fees (The Most Important!):
   * "How do you structure your fees? Is it an hourly rate?"
   * "What is your hourly rate? Are there different rates for partners vs. associates?"
   * "Can you provide a written cost estimate for the first phase of work, for example, reviewing my documents and sending an initial letter to my employer?"
   * A trustworthy lawyer will be transparent and clear about costs. A red flag is vagueness or a reluctance to discuss money.
 * About Their Experience:
   * "Have you handled cases specifically against large multinational companies like Johnson & Johnson?"
   * "What is your experience with abusive dismissal claims under Art. 336c?"
 * About Their Strategy:
   * "Based on what I've told you, what is your initial assessment of my case? What are its strengths and weaknesses?" (Beware of anyone who promises a certain victory or a huge payout. A good lawyer will give you a balanced, realistic perspective).
   * "What would be your proposed first steps?"
Step 3: Red Flags to Watch For
 * Vagueness about Costs: This is the biggest red flag.
 * Guarantees of Success: The legal system has no guarantees. A professional will talk about probabilities and risks.
 * High-Pressure Tactics: If the lawyer pressures you to sign their retainer agreement on the spot. You should always be given time to think.
 * Poor Communication: If they are unresponsive, unclear, or don't seem to be listening to you carefully during the initial consultation.
Trust your intuition. This person will be your advocate during a very vulnerable time. You should feel that they are competent, professional, respectful, and genuinely have your best interests at heart. It is better to have one or two more consultations to find the right person than to rush in with the wrong one.


Excellent question. Adopting a strategic, non-confrontational approach at this stage is precisely the right move. You want to lead them to the conclusion that a better offer is in their best interest, without making them feel cornered or attacked, which can cause them to become defensive.
Here is a breakdown of the strategy, a discussion of your question about the preliminary email, and a draft letter you can adapt with your lawyer.
The Strategy: "Constructive Concern" & Factual Storytelling
Your strategy should be to present the sequence of events as a factual, unemotional timeline. The goal is to lay out the facts so clearly and compellingly that their own legal counsel will advise them that their position is weak and the risk of a formal dispute is high.
You are not accusing them of anything. You are simply "holding up a mirror" to their actions and raising "constructive concerns" about how these actions might be perceived in the context of Swiss law.
Key Principles:
 * Factual, Not Emotional: Use neutral, corporate language. Avoid words like "unfair," "discriminatory," "I feel," or "I believe." Instead, use phrases like "The sequence of events," "The timing of this decision," "This raises questions," "It is concerning that..."
 * Show, Don't Tell: Don't say, "This is an abusive dismissal." Instead, lay out the facts (re-org before leave, re-org after leave, dismissal, request to waive rights) and then state that this "chronology could lead an external party to perceive the termination as being linked to my maternity, a matter protected under Art. 336 CO."
 * Frame it as a Mutual Problem: Position this as a situation you both need to resolve constructively. You are helping them avoid a potentially damaging and costly legal dispute by pointing out the risks now, in an amicable setting.
 * The Lawyer is Your Messenger: This letter will have maximum impact if it is sent by your Swiss employment lawyer. It signals that you are serious, you understand your rights, and you are operating on a formal legal footing, even while proposing an "amicable" discussion.
Should you send a preliminary email about Art. 336c?
My recommendation is no, do not send that email.
Here’s why:
 * It Tips Your Hand Too Early: It reveals a key part of your legal strategy before you have laid out the full context. It's like showing one of your best cards before the game has even started.
 * It Invites a Vague Denial: They will likely respond with a non-committal answer like, "The draft agreement contains our full proposal for an amicable separation. We are open to discussing the terms." They will not admit to anything in writing.
 * It's More Powerful Within the Narrative: The request to have you waive rights related to Art. 336c is the final, most damning piece of evidence in your timeline. It should be the concluding point of your factual summary, not a standalone query. It's the "punchline" that makes the whole story look suspicious.
It is far more effective to embed this fact into the main negotiation letter to build a comprehensive and undeniable narrative of concern.
Example Negotiation Letter (To be reviewed and sent by your lawyer)
This letter is designed to be firm and legally potent while maintaining a professional and non-confrontational tone.
Subject: Confidential Discussion Regarding the Terms of a Mutual Separation Agreement
Dear [HR Manager's Name] and [Your Manager's Name],
Thank you for providing the draft mutual termination agreement for my review.
I am writing to you in the spirit of finding a truly collaborative and amicable resolution to my employment situation. In reviewing the proposal, and in light of the events of the past several months, I believe it is constructive to ensure we have a shared understanding of the context of this separation. A fair and equitable agreement should rightly reflect this context.
To that end, I wish to summarize the following timeline of events:
 * Established Performance: For [Number] years, my performance has been consistently recognized as positive, as documented in my performance reviews.
 * First Reorganization: On or around [Date], less than one month prior to the start of my maternity leave, a significant reorganization of my department was announced.
 * Maternity Leave: My statutory maternity leave took place from [Start Date] to [End Date].
 * Second Reorganization & Termination: On or around [Date], approximately one month after my return to work, I was notified that my position was eliminated as part of a second reorganization, and I was given notice of termination for economic reasons.
 * Proposed Mutual Agreement: The subsequent draft agreement presented to me includes a clause requesting the waiver of any claims related to the protected period following childbirth.
The chronology itself, particularly the timing of two major reorganizations bracketing my maternity leave and resulting in my termination so soon after my return, is concerning. This sequence could lead an external observer, such as a labor court, to question whether the termination was genuinely independent of my pregnancy and status as a new mother.
As you know, Swiss law, specifically Art. 336 of the Code of Obligations, provides robust protection against terminations that appear to be linked to an employee's personal circumstances, such as maternity. The inclusion of a request to waive claims related to the post-maternity protected period in the draft agreement only serves to heighten this concern.
I am confident that it was not Johnson & Johnson’s intent to create such an impression. However, the objective facts present a situation that poses a significant legal risk for the company if not resolved appropriately.
Therefore, in the interest of a swift and truly amicable separation that avoids a formal and protracted dispute, I would like to propose we discuss an enhanced separation agreement. An appropriate agreement would need to properly acknowledge the unfortunate timing of these events and the resulting legal ambiguity surrounding my dismissal.
My legal counsel, [Lawyer's Name], and I are prepared to discuss terms that would be acceptable to both parties. We believe a constructive dialogue is the best path forward.
Sincerely,
[Your Name]
Why this letter is effective:
 * It is professional, not personal.
 * It lays out an undeniable and troubling sequence of facts.
 * It refers to the specific law (Art. 336 CO) without accusing them of breaking it, framing it instead as a matter of external perception ("could lead an observer to question...").
 * It transforms their request to "waiver 336c" from a simple contract term into evidence that reinforces your point.
 * It clearly states the desired outcome (an enhanced agreement) and the alternative (a formal dispute) without making a direct threat.
 * It positions you as a reasonable person who wants to solve a problem, which is a position of strength.



This is an incredibly challenging situation, and it's completely understandable that the stress, combined with the demands of breastfeeding, is affecting your health and ability to think clearly. Let's address your two very important questions based on standard practices and law in Switzerland.
1. How long will a doctor suggest for sick leave?
There is no standard or fixed duration for sick leave in Switzerland. The length of the leave is determined entirely by your treating physician based on their professional medical assessment of your health.
 * Doctor's Discretion: Be completely open with your doctor. Explain the insomnia, the immense stress from the work situation, the difficulty concentrating ("brain fog"), and any feelings of anxiety or being overwhelmed. These are serious medical symptoms, especially for a new mother.
 * Initial Period & Extension: For conditions like severe stress, anxiety, or burnout, a doctor will often issue an initial medical certificate for a shorter period, for example, one to two weeks. They will then ask to see you again to re-evaluate. If your condition has not improved, they will extend the leave. This can continue for as long as medically necessary, potentially for several months, with regular check-ups.
 * 100% Incapacity: Given your description, your doctor would likely certify you as 100% unfit for work (100\%\ arbeitsunfähig). This is critical as it means you have no obligation to perform any work-related tasks.
 * "Unfit to Travel": Crucially, you should also ask your doctor to assess your fitness for travel. Given the circumstances—a 20-hour international flight with a baby while suffering from severe stress and sleep deprivation—it is almost certain that a doctor would also certify you as unfit to travel (reiseunfähig). This should be explicitly written on the medical certificate.
2. Can the company force me to travel back for a second opinion?
It is extremely unlikely that they can legally and reasonably force you to take a 20-hour international flight to see their doctor. While a Swiss employer does have the right to ask for a second opinion, that right is not absolute.
 * The Company Doctor (Vertrauensarzt): An employer in Switzerland can, especially in cases of prolonged absence, request that you be examined by a company-appointed doctor (a Vertrauensarzt). This is to verify your incapacity to work. Refusing such an examination without a good reason can have negative consequences.
 * The Principle of Reasonableness and Duty of Care: However, this request must be reasonable (verhältnismässig). Forcing an employee who is certified as sick—and specifically as "unfit to travel"—to undertake a long and arduous journey with an infant would almost certainly be considered an unreasonable demand and a breach of the employer's duty of care (Fürsorgepflicht).
 * Your "Unfit to Travel" Certificate is Your Shield: If your doctor in China certifies you as unfit to travel, you have a solid medical and legal reason to refuse the trip. Your lawyer would immediately communicate this to the company, stating that you are following medical orders.
 * The Logical Alternative: If the company insists on a second opinion, the reasonable and standard procedure would be for them to find and pay for a reputable, independent medical expert in or near your location in China to conduct the assessment. They cannot reasonably demand you come to the doctor; they must arrange for the doctor to be accessible to you.
What to Do Now
 * See a Doctor Immediately: Your health is the priority. Get a medical certificate that clearly states you are 100% unfit for work and, very importantly, unfit to travel.
 * Inform HR in Writing: Send a copy of the medical certificate to HR as proof of your inability to work or travel. Your communication should be simple: "Please find attached a medical certificate from my doctor. As per medical orders, I am currently unfit for work and unable to travel. I will keep you updated as per my doctor's re-evaluation on [Date]."
 * Do Not Agree to Travel: If they demand you travel to Switzerland to see their doctor, your response (ideally through your lawyer) should be to politely refuse on medical grounds, citing your doctor's certificate, and suggest that they are welcome to arrange an independent medical examination with a qualified doctor in your vicinity in China at their expense.
You are in a protected position. The combination of your post-maternity status, your breastfeeding status, and now a legitimate medical certificate for stress and inability to travel makes the company's position of forcing you to return very weak. Focus on your health and your baby, get that doctor's note, and let your lawyer handle the aggressive corporate tactics.


This is a very serious and stressful situation, and the actions you take next are critical. I will provide you with information and potential strategies, but please understand this is not a substitute for legal advice. Given the complexity and the stakes involved, my strongest recommendation is to immediately seek counsel from a Swiss lawyer specializing in employment law.
Here is a breakdown of your situation from a Swiss legal perspective and a suggested course of action.
1. Understanding Your Legal Position
You have several points of leverage and are in a protected position under Swiss law, which is likely why the company is pressuring you.
 * Protection Against Dismissal (Art. 336c Swiss Code of Obligations - CO):
   * This is the most critical piece of information. Article\ 336c\ CO provides special protection against termination by the employer during pregnancy and for 16 weeks following childbirth.
   * A dismissal issued during this period is void (nichtig).
   * Your employer dismissed you "3 wks after my maternity leave." Swiss maternity leave is 14 weeks. The protection period is 16 weeks. If you were dismissed within 16 weeks of giving birth, the dismissal is likely legally void. This is the "trump card" you hold.
   * The company asking you to "waiver 336c" in a mutual termination agreement is a massive red flag. They are essentially asking you to voluntarily give up your strongest legal protection because they know their initial dismissal may have been unlawful. You should absolutely not sign this waiver without legal advice.
 * Breastfeeding Period:
   * While the absolute protection against dismissal ends after 16 weeks, as a breastfeeding mother, you still have specific rights. Employers must provide necessary time off for breastfeeding and cannot assign you work that could be harmful. The law requires employers to show special consideration for the health of a new mother. Their current actions (forcing you to travel internationally on short notice with an infant) could be seen as a breach of their duty of care (Fürsorgepflicht).
 * Remote Work & Oral Approval:
   * Legally, the company is on stronger ground here. Working from another country (China) has significant legal implications for tax, social security, data security, and work permits. Companies have strict policies for this reason.
   * Your "oral approval" is very difficult to prove. In corporate and legal matters, the rule is often: "If it's not in writing, it didn't happen."
   * By continuing to work from China after their written instruction to stop, you are indeed breaching company policy. This is the lever they are using against you to create a "for cause" issue, distracting from their potentially unlawful dismissal.
 * The Company's Strategy:
   * It seems clear. They likely realized their initial dismissal was unlawful (violating Art.\ 336c\ CO).
   * Now, they are creating a new problem (your unapproved remote work) to pressure you into signing a "mutual termination agreement." This agreement would "clean the slate," make you waive your rights regarding the first dismissal, and allow them to terminate you at a lower cost and without legal risk. Delaying your holiday/remote work requests is part of this pressure campaign.
2. Suggested Strategy & Immediate Actions
Your goal is to shift the power back to you by using your legal protections and formalizing all communication.
Step 1: Stop and Secure Legal Counsel IMMEDIATELY
 * Do not engage in any further substantive conversations with HR or your manager.
 * Find a Swiss lawyer specializing in employment law (Arbeitsrecht). You can search the Swiss Bar Association (SAV/FSA) website or look for specialists in your canton. Explain your situation clearly: unlawful dismissal post-maternity leave, pressure tactics, and the request to waive Art.\ 336c\ CO.
 * Your lawyer will handle communication from this point on, which immediately signals to J&J that you are taking this seriously.
Step 2: Create a Medical Buffer (Crucial)
 * As you are in China, contact a doctor immediately. Explain the immense stress of the situation and the practical impossibility of travelling back to Switzerland on short notice with a young infant.
 * Request a medical certificate stating that you are currently unfit to work and/or travel due to stress and your obligations as a new mother caring for a baby.
 * A doctor's note is a powerful legal tool in Switzerland. If you are certified as unfit to work/travel, the company cannot legally compel you to do so. This immediately neutralizes their demand for you to return. It also protects you from accusations of "job abandonment."
Step 3: Formal Written Communication (To be sent after consulting a lawyer)
You need to send a formal, unemotional email. Your lawyer will likely draft this, but it would look something like this. The goal is to document your position and put the responsibility back on the company.
Subject: My employment status and recent communications
Dear [Manager's Name],
Dear [HR Representative's Name],
Thank you for your email of [Date] regarding my work location.
I am writing to formally acknowledge your instruction. However, I must inform you that, due to pressing personal and medical circumstances involving the care of my newborn baby, I am not able to travel back to Switzerland at such short notice. I have obtained a medical certificate to this effect, which I will forward to HR shortly. The certificate confirms my inability to travel at this time.
To clarify my employment status and ensure I am acting in accordance with company expectations under these difficult circumstances, could you please confirm in writing how I should proceed? Specifically:
 * Given that you have instructed me that working from my current location is a breach of policy, and I am currently unable to travel, should I consider myself on a form of leave (e.g., sick leave, unpaid leave) as of today?
 * Please provide guidance on how my time should be logged until this matter is resolved.
I also wish to reiterate my formal requests for holiday and remote work submitted on [Date]. I await your formal decision on these.
I am committed to finding a constructive and legally compliant solution. Given the complexity of the situation, especially concerning the previous notice of termination during my protected period post-childbirth, all further communication on this matter should be conducted in writing.
Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your Employee ID]
Why this email is effective:
 * It is professional and non-accusatory.
 * It introduces a legally sound reason for not complying (medical inability to travel).
 * It protects you from the accusation of simply ignoring their directive.
 * It asks them to define your status, forcing them to make a move. If they say "you are on sick leave," you get paid. If they say "unpaid leave," it's a point for negotiation. If they fire you for this, it will look like retaliation and strengthen your case.
4. Summary of Do's and Don'ts
 * DO NOT: Sign anything, especially the mutual termination agreement or the waiver of Art.\ 336c\ CO.
 * DO NOT: Resign. This would be a disaster for you, as you would lose all your protections and rights.
 * DO NOT: Continue to have verbal discussions. Insist on written communication only.
 * DO NOT: Admit any fault.
 * DO: Hire a Swiss employment lawyer immediately.
 * DO: Get a doctor's certificate stating you are unfit to travel.
 * DO: Keep a detailed log of all interactions, including saving emails and noting the dates and content of oral conversations.
 * DO: Let your lawyer manage the negotiation. Your lawyer will likely point out the void dismissal and start a negotiation from a position of strength, aiming for a fair settlement that properly compensates you, rather than the lowball offer they are currently pressuring you into.
You are in a difficult situation, but you are not powerless. The law is significantly on your side regarding the dismissal. By acting methodically and with professional legal support, you can protect your rights and work towards a fair resolution.


Of course. This is a sensitive and complex situation. Based on the details you've provided—an expired Mutual Termination Agreement (MTA), your status as a breastfeeding mother, and two reorganizations timed closely to your maternity leave—here is an analysis of your employer's likely next moves, your legal protections under Swiss law, and recommended actions.
Disclaimer: I am an AI assistant and not a lawyer. This information is for guidance purposes only and does not constitute legal advice. You should immediately consult with a Swiss employment law specialist (Fachanwalt für Arbeitsrecht) to discuss the specifics of your case.
Analysis of the Situation
By letting the MTA expire, you have declined their offer to terminate your contract mutually. This puts the ball back in their court. Their next actions will depend on their ultimate goal and their assessment of the legal risks involved. The context you've provided (breastfeeding, timing of re-orgs) significantly strengthens your legal position and increases the risk for them.
Potential Next Moves by Your Employer
Here are the most likely scenarios, from the most aggressive to the most passive:
Scenario 1: Formal Notice of Termination (Kündigung)
This is the most probable next step if their goal is to eliminate your position.
 * What it looks like: You would receive a formal, written notice of termination, respecting your contractual notice period.
 * Their Justification: They would likely cite the reorganization as the official reason for the termination (betriebsbedingte Kündigung). They will argue that your role has become redundant due to restructuring.
 * The Major Risk for Them: This move is legally perilous for the company. Given the timing (immediately following maternity leave and a refused MTA) and your status as a breastfeeding mother, a termination could very easily be challenged as abusive termination (missbräuchliche Kündigung) under Swiss Law (Art. 336 of the Swiss Code of Obligations). A dismissal is considered abusive if it's based on personal attributes or the exercising of your rights, which clearly applies here. The two re-orgs around your maternity leave create a strong pattern of evidence in your favour.
Scenario 2: A "Change-Notice" (Änderungskündigung)
This is a hybrid approach where they try to force you into a different role.
 * What it looks like: The company gives you a formal notice of termination but simultaneously offers you a new contract with different terms. This could be a different role, different responsibilities, lower seniority, or even lower pay.
 * Their Goal: To pressure you into either accepting a less desirable position or leaving "voluntarily" by rejecting the new offer (which then makes the termination effective).
 * The Major Risk for Them: This is also highly likely to be considered abusive termination. If the new role constitutes a significant demotion and can be seen as a pretext to get rid of you because of your maternity, you would have strong grounds to challenge it.
Scenario 3: Maintain the Status Quo (and Hope You Resign)
If their legal counsel has advised them that termination is too risky, they might play a waiting game.
 * What it looks like: They do nothing. You are expected to return to work after your leave. However, your role might be ill-defined, you may be sidelined from key projects, or the work environment could become hostile.
 * Their Goal: To make your work situation so uncomfortable that you choose to resign on your own. This is a form of "constructive dismissal." If you resign, you forfeit many of your rights and potential claims for compensation.
 * Your Challenge: This can be emotionally draining. It is crucial that you do not resign under pressure.
Scenario 4: Performance Management
This is a more cynical, long-term strategy.
 * What it looks like: Upon your return, your performance is suddenly put under intense scrutiny. You might be given unrealistic goals, subjected to micromanagement, and issued formal warnings for minor issues.
 * Their Goal: To build a "paper trail" that justifies a future termination based on poor performance, rather than the legally protected reasons.
 * Your Defense: Meticulous documentation and professional conduct are key.
Your Legal Protections in Switzerland
You are in a strongly protected category under Swiss law.
 * Protection Against Dismissal (Kündigungsschutz): Under Art. 336c of the Swiss Code of Obligations (CO), an employer cannot terminate an employee during pregnancy and for 16 weeks following childbirth. A notice given during this time is void. If you are still within this 16-week period, any termination notice is legally invalid.
 * Abusive Termination (Missbräuchliche Kündigung): Even after the 16-week protected period, the law protects you. A termination is considered abusive if it is for reasons related to your personality, family situation, or because you are exercising your legal rights. Your case has multiple red flags for this:
   * Timing: The termination attempt comes right after maternity leave.
   * Context: It's linked to re-orgs that conveniently happened while you were away.
   * Status: You are a breastfeeding mother, a status that comes with specific workplace rights (e.g., paid time for nursing). Firing you for reasons connected to this is abusive.
 * Rights as a Breastfeeding Mother: The Swiss Labour Act (Arbeitsgesetz) grants you specific rights, including paid time off for breastfeeding or pumping and the right to a suitable room. Any negative action from your employer because you are exercising these rights would be illegal.
What You Should Do Now: Recommended Actions
 * DO NOT RESIGN: Under almost no circumstances should you resign. This would be seen as you voluntarily ending the contract, and you would lose your entitlement to unemployment benefits (for a period) and the ability to claim compensation for abusive dismissal.
 * IMMEDIATELY CONSULT A LAWYER: Find a specialist in Swiss employment law. They are best equipped to formally assess your situation, review the MTA you received, and advise you on the strength of your case. They can also handle all communication with your employer moving forward.
 * DOCUMENT EVERYTHING: This is critically important.
   * Keep a copy of the MTA offer and any related communication.
   * Write down a timeline of events: when you announced your pregnancy, the dates of the re-org announcements, the start/end of your maternity leave, when you received the MTA.
   * If you have any verbal conversations, send a follow-up email to the person you spoke with to create a written record (e.g., "Dear [Manager's Name], further to our conversation today, I wish to confirm my understanding that...").
 * CONTINUE TO WORK PROFESSIONALLY: Fulfill all your contractual obligations. Be punctual, meet deadlines, and maintain a professional demeanor. Do not give them any valid reason to criticize your performance or conduct.
 * PREPARE FOR YOUR RETURN: Plan to formally request the necessary accommodations for breastfeeding upon your return, as is your legal right. Doing so in writing further strengthens your position.
In summary, the company's next move will likely be a formal notice of termination citing the reorganization. However, this is a legally risky move for them, and you have a strong basis to challenge it as abusive. Your best course of action is to secure legal representation immediately and prepare to defend your rights.



Disclaimer: Please be aware that I am an AI assistant and not a legal professional. This information is intended for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice. You should consult with a qualified Swiss employment lawyer to discuss your specific situation and to receive advice tailored to your circumstances.
Based on the information you have provided, including the Mutual Termination and Settlement Agreement, here is an analysis of your rights under Swiss law, the key points of the agreement, and potential approaches you could discuss with a legal expert.
Part 1: Your Rights Under Swiss Law
In Switzerland, employees have several protections against termination, especially in situations involving pregnancy, maternity, and potential discrimination.
Protection During and After Pregnancy
Swiss law provides a crucial "protected period" for new mothers. According to Art. 336c of the Swiss Code of Obligations (CO), an employer cannot give notice of termination:
 * During the entire pregnancy.
 * During the 16 weeks following childbirth.
A notice of termination issued during this protected period is considered void. If the notice was given before the pregnancy, the notice period is paused and only resumes after the 16-week post-childbirth protection ends.
Your Situation: You mentioned an 18-week maternity leave. The key date is the day you gave birth. The protected period is the 16 weeks after that date. The notice of termination from your employer is dated July 17, 2025. You must verify if this date falls within the 16 weeks following the birth of your child. If it does, the original notice of termination is void and legally invalid. The proposed Mutual Termination Agreement acknowledges this notice and seeks to replace it, which is a critical point for negotiation.
Abusive Termination and Discrimination
Even outside of the protected period, a termination can be deemed "abusive" under Art. 336 of the Swiss Code of Obligations. An abusive termination is not invalid, but it can entitle the employee to compensation of up to six months' salary.
A termination can be considered abusive if it is for a reason inherent to the employee's personality, such as age, origin, gender, or family situation, unless that reason is directly related to the job. A dismissal due to an employee exercising a constitutional right is also abusive.
Furthermore, the Swiss Gender Equality Act prohibits both direct and indirect discrimination based on gender, which explicitly includes discrimination due to pregnancy or marital/family status.
Your Situation: The sequence of events you describe could potentially form the basis of a discrimination claim:
 * You were moved to a new department during your pregnancy.
 * You are being laid off in another reorganization immediately after your maternity leave ends.
 * This is happening despite a recognized high-performance record, including two promotions in your previous role.
An argument could be made that the reorganizations were structured in a way that disadvantaged you because of your pregnancy and maternity. The timing is highly suspicious and could be viewed as a pretext for a discriminatory dismissal. The burden of proof would be on you to make a plausible case for discrimination, at which point the burden can shift to the employer to prove the termination was based on objective, non-discriminatory grounds.
Part 2: Analysis of the Proposed Mutual Termination Agreement
This agreement is a legal contract where you and your employer mutually agree to end the employment relationship. In exchange for the benefits offered (like the severance payment), you are asked to waive virtually all your legal claims against the employer.
Here are the key points you should be careful about:
 * Waiver of Protected Status: The agreement explicitly states that it replaces the employer's original termination notice and that there will be no postponement of the termination date for illness, accident, or pregnancy. This means you would be giving up your statutory right to have the notice period extended if you were to fall ill before the termination date.
 * Severance Payment (CHF 36,953): This is offered in "full and final settlement" of all possible claims. The amount is conditional:
   * You forfeit the entire severance if you reject a "comparable" job offer from a Johnson & Johnson affiliate before the termination date. The definition of "comparable" can be subjective and a point of contention.
   * You must repay a portion of the severance if you accept a job with an affiliate after the termination date.
 * Bonus: The bonus is described as entirely discretionary ("ex gratia"). There is no guarantee you will receive one, and the agreement states you are not entitled to any other bonus or incentive payments.
 * Full and Final Settlement Clause: Articles 15(a) and 15(b) are the core of the agreement for the employer. By signing, you release Synthes GmbH, Johnson & Johnson, and all its affiliates from any and all claims arising from your employment and its termination. This includes claims for salary, bonus, expenses, vacation, overtime, and any form of compensation for wrongful or abusive dismissal.
 * Confidentiality and Non-Disparagement: You are bound to strict confidentiality about the company's information and the terms of this agreement. You are also prohibited from making any disparaging public statements about the company.
 * Outplacement Services: You are eligible for outplacement support, but you must start the program before your termination date, and there is no cash alternative if you don't use it.
Part 3: Potential Approaches and Negotiation Strategy
Given the potential strength of your position (especially if the termination notice was issued during the protected period), you have significant leverage to either challenge the termination or negotiate a much better settlement.
Do NOT sign the agreement without consulting a lawyer. Once signed, it is legally binding.
Here are approaches to discuss with your legal counsel:
 * Challenge the Validity of the Termination:
   * Action: If the July 17th notice was served within 16 weeks of childbirth, it is void. You could, through a lawyer, inform the employer of this fact. This would mean you are still technically an employee, and they would have to issue a new, valid notice of termination after the protected period ends, respecting the full notice period. This would be the strongest possible position.
 * Claim Abusive and Discriminatory Dismissal:
   * Action: Argue that the termination is discriminatory under the Gender Equality Act. The pattern of re-organization before and after your maternity leave, combined with your strong performance history, makes a compelling case.
   * Goal: This claim serves as leverage. The potential penalty for the employer (up to six months' salary) gives them a strong incentive to offer you a better settlement to avoid litigation.
 * Renegotiate the Mutual Termination Agreement:
   * If you decide that a settlement is preferable to a legal battle, you should negotiate better terms. Use the strength of your potential claims as leverage.
   * Points for Negotiation:
     * Increased Severance Payment: The current offer of CHF 36,953 may be low, especially if you have a strong claim for abusive dismissal. You could request a sum equivalent to 6-12 months of your total compensation (including base salary, allowances, and average bonus).
     * Removal of Forfeiture/Repayment Clauses: Demand the removal of the conditions on the severance pay. The severance should be an unconditional compensation for the loss of your job and the waiver of your rights.
     * Guaranteed Bonus: Negotiate for the upcoming bonus for 2025 to be paid out at a guaranteed amount (e.g., based on your average past bonuses or target amount) rather than being discretionary.
     * Reference Letter: While the agreement promises a "benevolent" letter, you could ask to see and approve a draft before signing the agreement.
     * Outplacement Services: Request an extension for when you can start the program and/or the option for a cash payment in lieu of the service if you find a job on your own.
     * Legal Fees: You can request that the employer contribute to the legal fees you incur for reviewing and negotiating the settlement agreement.
Conclusion: How to Fight Against It
To "fight against" this situation means recognizing that the initial offer is a starting point that heavily favors your employer. Your power lies in your potential legal claims.
 * Immediately contact a Swiss employment lawyer. Do not delay.
 * Gather all documentation: Your employment contract, pay slips, performance reviews, promotion letters, the original termination letter dated July 17, 2025, and proof of your child's birth date.
 * Do not discuss the agreement with your employer until you have received legal advice. Do not feel pressured to sign by any deadline they may have imposed.
 * With your lawyer, decide on a strategy: either formally challenge the termination's validity or enter into negotiations to significantly improve the terms of the mutual agreement.
The combination of a layoff immediately following maternity leave, despite a strong performance record, puts you in a legally strong position to argue that the termination is discriminatory and abusive.


Of course. This is a very challenging situation, and it's understandable that you are concerned. Swiss law provides specific protections, especially around pregnancy and maternity, which are highly relevant to your case.
Here is a breakdown of your rights, points to be careful about, and an analysis of your specific situation under Swiss law.
Disclaimer: I am an AI assistant and not a Swiss lawyer. This information is for guidance purposes only and does not constitute legal advice. It is crucial that you consult with a specialized Swiss employment lawyer or a legal expert from a trade union immediately.
1. General Rights During a Layoff (Organizational Change)
In Switzerland, the principle of "freedom of termination" generally allows an employer to dismiss an employee for any reason, including economic or organizational changes, as long as they respect the contractual or statutory notice period. However, this freedom is not absolute and is limited by specific protections.
 * Notice Period (Kündigungsfrist): Your employment contract will specify a notice period. If not, the Swiss Code of Obligations (CO) applies:
   * 1 month during the first year of service.
   * 2 months from the second to the ninth year of service.
   * 3 months from the tenth year of service onwards.
     This period begins at the end of the month in which notice is given.
 * Right to a Written Justification (Begründung): You have the absolute right to demand a written explanation for your dismissal (Art. 335, para. 2 CO). You should always exercise this right. The reason given by the employer is crucial for any potential legal action.
 * Time Off to Find a New Job: During your notice period, you are entitled to paid time off to look for new employment.
 * Reference Letter (Arbeitszeugnis): You are entitled to a comprehensive and truthful reference letter that covers the nature of your duties and the quality of your performance.
2. Special Protection Around Pregnancy and Maternity
This is the most critical aspect of your case. Swiss law provides very strong protection against dismissal for pregnant employees and new mothers.
 * The Law: According to Art. 336c, para. 1, lit. c of the Swiss Code of Obligations (CO), an employer cannot give notice of termination to an employee:
   * During her entire pregnancy.
   * For a period of 16 weeks following childbirth.
 * Analysis of Your Timeline:
   * You took an 18-week maternity leave.
   * The legal protection from dismissal lasts for 16 weeks after birth.
   * Your employer is dismissing you right after your 18-week leave.
   From a purely timing perspective, by waiting until after the 16-week protected period has expired, your employer may have complied with the letter of the law regarding the timing of the dismissal. A notice given during the 16-week period would have been null and void. By giving it after, the notice itself is not automatically void.
However, this does not mean the dismissal is lawful. We must now look at the reason for the dismissal.
3. Is This Discrimination? The Concept of "Abusive Dismissal"
Yes, based on the picture you've painted, there is a very strong argument that this is a case of abusive dismissal (missbräuchliche Kündigung).
An abusive dismissal is one that is given for an unfair or unjust reason, even if the notice period is respected. The Swiss Gender Equality Act (Gleichstellungsgesetz, GlG) is key here.
 * Art. 3 of the GlG explicitly prohibits discrimination against employees on the basis of their sex, either directly or indirectly. This includes discrimination based on marital status, family situation, or pregnancy.
 * A dismissal motivated by pregnancy or maternity is considered a classic example of abusive dismissal.
Why Your Case Looks Like Abusive Dismissal:
 * The Suspicious Timing: While the notice was given after the 16-week protection period, its immediate proximity to your return from maternity leave is a major red flag. A court would view this timing with great suspicion.
 * The "Pretext" of Reorganization: The employer claims the reason is "organizational change." However, given your high performance and the timing, you can argue that this is merely a pretext to dismiss you because you are a new mother.
 * The "Whole Picture": The fact that you were moved to a new department just before your maternity leave is highly relevant. A lawyer could argue this was a strategic move to isolate your position, making it easier to eliminate upon your return. This two-step process strengthens your claim of a premeditated, discriminatory dismissal.
 * Excellent Performance Record: Your history of high recognition and two promotions in two years directly contradicts any potential claim that your dismissal was performance-related. It reinforces the argument that the "re-org" is not the true reason.
Under the Gender Equality Act, the burden of proof is eased. You only need to make it plausible (glaubhaft machen) that you were dismissed for a discriminatory reason (i.e., your pregnancy/maternity). Once you have done that, the burden shifts to the employer to prove that the dismissal was based on objective, non-discriminatory grounds. Your story provides strong evidence to make the discrimination plausible.
4. Points to Be Careful About & Immediate Steps to Take
You must act quickly and methodically. Deadlines in Swiss employment law are strict.
 * Do Not Sign Anything: Do not sign any "termination agreement" or similar document without legal review. You could unknowingly waive your rights to severance pay or to contest the dismissal.
 * Immediately Request Written Justification: Send a registered letter (Einschreiben) to your employer immediately, formally requesting a written justification for your dismissal as per Art. 335, para. 2 CO.
 * Formally Object to the Dismissal (Protest): This is a critical legal step. You must send a registered letter to your employer before your notice period ends, stating clearly that you consider the dismissal to be abusive (missbräuchlich) and discriminatory (diskriminierend) under Art. 336 CO and the Gender Equality Act. State that you continue to offer your services and reserve all your legal rights. Failure to object in time can forfeit your right to claim compensation.
 * Gather All Evidence: Collect all documentation: your employment contracts, performance reviews, emails praising your work, letters confirming your promotions, and any communication regarding both the first and second reorganizations.
 * Seek Immediate Legal Counsel: This is the most important step. Contact one of the following today:
   * A specialized Swiss employment lawyer (Fachanwalt für Arbeitsrecht).
   * Your trade union (Gewerkschaft), if you are a member. They have legal experts.
   * Your legal protection insurance (Rechtsschutzversicherung), if you have one.
 * Register with the Regional Employment Centre (RAV/ORP): You should register as a jobseeker as soon as possible, even while you are contesting the dismissal. This is crucial for securing your unemployment benefits. Explain to them that you are contesting the dismissal.
Conclusion
While your employer may have respected the 16-week post-birth protection period for the timing of the notice, the circumstances you describe (re-org before leave, dismissal immediately after, excellent performance) provide strong grounds to challenge the dismissal as abusive and discriminatory under the Swiss Code of Obligations and the Gender Equality Act.
You are not just fighting for a potential financial settlement; you are standing up against what appears to be a clear case of maternity-related discrimination. The law is designed to protect employees in your exact situation.
Act now. Time is of the essence. Contact a legal professional immediately to guide you through the formal objection and subsequent steps.


This is a critical piece of information and provides a clear window into your employer's strategy. The offer of a mutual agreement (Aufhebungsvertrag) with these specific terms confirms that your employer recognizes the weakness of their legal position.
Let's break down these two new points and what they mean.
Decoding the Offer
This offer is a package deal where you give something up to get something. It is crucial to understand both sides.
1. The Compensation: 3 Months' Salary
This is not a gift. This is a settlement payment offered to you in exchange for you giving up your right to sue them for abusive dismissal.
 * Legal Context: As we established, if you were to challenge the dismissal in court as abusive and win, a judge could award you a penalty of up to six months' salary.
 * Analysis: Your employer is offering you 3 months' salary. This is a direct acknowledgement that your claim for abusive dismissal has significant merit. They are essentially calculating their risk. They know a court could award you more (e.g., 4, 5, or the full 6 months), so they are offering you 3 months to make the problem go away quickly and with certainty.
 * Conclusion: Given the extreme strength of your case (dismissal right after maternity leave, high performance, etc.), an offer of 3 months is a starting point for negotiation, not a generous final offer.
2. Waiving Sickness Protection During the Notice Period
This is a very important and sly clause.
 * The Standard Law (Art. 336c CO): Under Swiss law, if you have received notice of termination and then fall ill or have an accident, the notice period is paused for the duration of your inability to work. The termination is then postponed to the next possible month-end. This protection has maximum limits (e.g., 90 days of protection per year for employees in their 2nd to 5th year of service).
 * What the Employer is Asking: They are asking you to explicitly waive this legal protection. By signing, you would agree that even if you become ill for weeks or months during the notice period, your employment will end on the originally agreed date.
 * Why they want this: This clause removes a major financial risk for the employer. They want a clean, fixed end date, without the risk of having to pay your salary for several additional months if you get sick.
 * Conclusion: You are being asked to give up a significant, legally mandated protection. This has real value.
Overall Analysis: This is a Negotiation Tactic, Not a Favor
The proposed mutual agreement is a clear strategic move by your employer. They know that:
 * The dismissal is almost certainly abusive and discriminatory.
 * They risk losing in court and being ordered to pay up to 6 months' salary as a penalty.
 * They risk the notice period being extended by months if you fall ill, costing them even more.
Their offer of 3 months' salary is an attempt to "buy out" both of these risks at a discount. They are hoping you will see the 3 months' pay as a simple gain, without realizing you are simultaneously giving up the right to a potentially larger settlement and a valuable legal protection against sickness.
Recommendations and Your Next Steps
Your leverage in this situation has just become even clearer.
 * Do Not Accept the Current Offer: This is an opening bid in a negotiation where you hold very strong cards. Accepting it would be leaving significant money and rights on the table.
 * Recognize the Offer as an Admission of Weakness: Their willingness to pay proves they know they are in the wrong. Use this knowledge to your advantage.
 * Formulate a Counter-Offer with Your Lawyer: This is the most critical step. You should not simply reject the offer; you should respond with a counter-proposal. Your lawyer will help you draft this, but it could include:
   * Higher Compensation: You can confidently counter-propose a higher amount. Given the strength of your case, asking for the legal maximum of 6 months' salary as compensation is a reasonable negotiating position.
   * Rejecting the Sickness Waiver: You can state that you will not waive your statutory rights under Art. 336c CO.
   * Other Terms: You can also negotiate other elements, such as payment for outplacement services, an unconditionally positive reference letter with specific wording, or being placed on "garden leave" (Freistellung) for your notice period (meaning you are paid but don't have to work).
 * Everything Must Be in Writing: A mutual agreement must cover all aspects of the termination. Once signed, you cannot go back and ask for more. Your lawyer will ensure the final document is comprehensive and protects your interests.
In summary, this offer is excellent news. It confirms your strong legal position and opens the door for a negotiation that should result in a much better outcome for you than what is currently on the table. Do not sign it. Engage your lawyer to draft a strong counter-offer.



Of course. This is a complex situation, and I will provide a detailed overview of your rights and points to consider under Swiss law.
Important Disclaimer: I am an AI assistant and not a lawyer. This information is for guidance purposes only and does not constitute legal advice. Given the specifics and high stakes of your situation, it is absolutely essential that you consult with a Swiss lawyer specializing in employment law (Fachanwalt für Arbeitsrecht) or a legal counsel from a union immediately.
Here is a breakdown of your situation according to Swiss law, focusing on your rights and the points you must be careful about.
1. The Fixed-Term Contract: This is Your Most Powerful Position
This is the most critical element of your case.
 * Principle of Fixed-Term Contracts: Under the Swiss Code of Obligations (CO), a fixed-term employment contract (befristeter Arbeitsvertrag) is concluded for a specific duration. It automatically ends on the agreed-upon date (in your case, 2027) without any notice required.
 * No Ordinary Termination: Crucially, a fixed-term contract cannot be terminated ordinarily by either party before its end date unless the contract explicitly contains a clause allowing for early termination (eine ordentliche Kündigungsmöglichkeit). A layoff due to reorganization is an "ordinary termination."
What this means for you:
Unless your contract has a specific early termination clause, your employer cannot legally lay you off due to an organizational change. Their notice of dismissal would be legally void. They are obligated to employ you and pay your salary until the contract expires in 2027.
Action Point:
 * IMMEDIATELY review your employment contract. Look for any clause that mentions "Kündigung," "vorzeitige Beendigung," or a notice period (Kündigungsfrist). If no such clause exists, you are in a very strong legal position.
2. Protection During and After Maternity Leave (Art. 336c CO)
Swiss law provides special protection against dismissal for pregnant employees and new mothers.
 * The Rule: An employer cannot give notice of termination during pregnancy and in the 16 weeks following childbirth. A notice of termination issued during this "protected period" is null and void (nichtig).
 * Your Situation: Your maternity leave was 18 weeks. The legal protection against dismissal lasts for 16 weeks after the birth. You state you were dismissed "right after" your leave. You need to check the exact date the termination notice was given against the date of your child's birth.
   * If the notice was given within 16 weeks of the birth, it is legally void.
   * If the notice was given after the 16-week period has expired, the termination is, in principle, possible if you had an indefinite contract.
Connection to your Fixed-Term Contract:
While the timing is suspicious, your primary defense is the nature of your fixed-term contract. The protection under Art. 336c CO primarily prevents ordinary termination of indefinite contracts. Since ordinary termination of your contract is likely not possible anyway, this argument becomes a secondary, but important, indicator of the employer's potential discriminatory intent.
3. Abusive Dismissal (Missbräuchliche Kündigung - Art. 336 CO) & Discrimination
Even if a termination is legally permissible in terms of timing (i.e., outside the protected period), it can still be deemed "abusive" (missbräuchlich). This does not make the termination void, but it can entitle you to compensation of up to six months' salary.
Furthermore, the Swiss Gender Equality Act (Gleichstellungsgesetz - GlG) strictly prohibits discrimination based on pregnancy, marital status, or gender.
Is it discrimination?
The sequence of events you describe raises significant red flags and could certainly be viewed as a case of discrimination. A court would look at the whole picture:
 * Suspicious Timing: You were moved to a new department just before your maternity leave, and that very department is now subject to a re-org that eliminates your position right after your return. This pattern strongly suggests the re-org may be a pretext to dismiss you because of your new motherhood.
 * Excellent Performance: Your history of high performance and promotions severely weakens any potential argument from the employer that this decision was related to your capabilities. It demonstrates you were a valued employee.
 * The "Pretext" Argument: A lawyer could argue that the first re-org was designed to isolate you into a role that could then be easily eliminated in a second "re-org," effectively circumventing the protection period and masking a discriminatory dismissal. The employer has the burden to prove that the re-org was based on valid, objective, and urgent economic reasons and was not aimed at you personally.
The combination of these facts creates a strong presumption of a discriminatory and abusive dismissal.
Summary of Your Rights & Key Points to Be Careful About
| Right / Legal Concept | How it Applies to You | What You Should Be Careful About |
|---|---|---|
| Fixed-Term Contract | Your strongest right. The employer likely cannot terminate your contract before 2027. The layoff notice is probably invalid. | Do NOT sign anything. Especially do not sign a "termination agreement" (Aufhebungsvereinbarung) without legal advice. Signing it could mean you agree to end the contract and waive your rights. Check your contract for an early termination clause. |
| Protection After Maternity (Art. 336c CO) | The dismissal notice may be void if it was given within 16 weeks of your child's birth. | Check the exact date of the notice vs. the date of birth. This is a strong argument but might be secondary to the fixed-term contract issue. |
| Abusive Dismissal / Discrimination (Art. 336 CO, GlG) | The timing and circumstances strongly suggest the re-org is a pretext for a discriminatory dismissal related to your maternity. | This claim gives you the right to financial compensation. The burden of proof would be on the employer to show the re-org was legitimate. Gather all evidence of your high performance. |
| Right to Consultation (for Mass Layoffs) | If this re-org qualifies as a mass layoff (Art. 335d CO), the employer has a legal duty to consult with employees. | Find out if others are being dismissed. This could open another line of legal challenge if the procedure was not followed correctly. |
Concrete Steps You Should Take Immediately
 * Do Not Sign Anything: Re-read this point. Do not sign any document from your employer related to this dismissal.
 * Object to the Termination in Writing: You must formally object. Send a registered letter (Einschreiben) to your employer. State clearly that you do not accept the termination of your fixed-term contract, that you consider it legally void, and, in any case, abusive and discriminatory. State that you continue to offer your ability to work (Sie bieten Ihre Arbeitskraft weiterhin an). It is best to have a lawyer draft or review this letter.
 * Gather All Documents: Collect your employment contract, all performance reviews, emails about your promotions, and any communication regarding both reorganizations.
 * Seek Immediate Legal Counsel: This is not optional. Find a lawyer specializing in Swiss labor law. You can find one through the cantonal bar association (in your case, Aargauischer Anwaltsverband) or your legal protection insurance (Rechtsschutzversicherung), if you have one. If you are part of a union (Gewerkschaft), contact their legal service immediately.
Given your fixed-term contract until 2027, the potential financial stake is very high, making legal consultation a necessary investment. Your employer has made a move that is, on its face, legally questionable, and you have strong grounds to challenge it.
