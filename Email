Thank you for providing the draft mutual termination agreement. I have carefully reviewed the proposed terms and would like to raise a few points before moving forward.

Since joining the company in September 2023, my performance has consistently been recognized, leading to both a salary increase and a promotion. I have always been committed to contributing positively to the team and supporting business goals.

However, I would like to express my concerns regarding the timing and context of my termination. The decision to eliminate my position came just three weeks after my return from statutory maternity leave (Feb 20 – Jun 25). This was the second reorganization within my department in a short period, the first having occurred just before the start of my leave. While I understand the business rationale shared with me, the close proximity between my return from maternity leave and the termination could raise questions from an external perspective about whether the decision was entirely independent of my recent leave and family status.

In addition, the proposed agreement includes a waiver of protection under Swiss Code of Obligations Art. 336c, which would normally extend the notice period in case of illness, pregnancy, or military service. This waiver removes a legal protection afforded to me under Swiss law. 

I would also like to clarify that my current temporary arrangement of staying in China to breastfeed my newborn was discussed and orally aligned with my manager prior to my departure. My intention was always to comply with internal processes and I have already proposed an alternative solution to mitigate the deviation.It was never my intention to breach any contractual obligations.

Given the above, I respectfully request that the severance package be adjusted to reflect these circumstances. Specifically, I ask that two additional months of salary be added to the proposed package. This would fairly acknowledge:
	•	The timing and context of the termination.
	•	The legal rights I would be waiving under the current draft.
	•	My commitment to resolving this matter amicably and avoiding legal escalation.

I remain fully open to finalizing this agreement cooperatively.

Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to your response.
